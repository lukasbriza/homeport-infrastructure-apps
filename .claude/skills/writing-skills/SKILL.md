name: writing-skills
description: Use when creating a new skill file in .claude/skills/, updating an existing skill, reviewing skill quality, or when asked to document a repo pattern as a reusable agent instruction.
---

## Overview

Writing skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation. The iron law: **NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST.** Before writing a skill, demonstrate that the agent behaves incorrectly without it. Then write the minimal skill that fixes the failure.

A skill is a `SKILL.md` file in `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` that teaches the AI agent how to handle a specific area of this repo.

---

## When to Use

- Creating a new skill for an undocumented repo area
- Updating an existing skill that no longer matches the repo
- Reviewing whether a skill is effective or has gaps

---

## Core Pattern: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR

### RED — Establish Baseline Failure

1. Identify a task the agent handles poorly without guidance
2. Run the task WITHOUT the skill present
3. Document exact failures: wrong patterns, missed conventions, broken rules
4. Note specific rationalizations the agent uses to justify shortcuts

Examples of baseline failures in this project:
- Agent references migration phases or task numbers in a YAML/config comment instead of
  just technical rationale (see `CLAUDE.md` — Conventions)
- Agent adds a standalone PVC without `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep`, risking data loss
  on `helm uninstall`
- Agent edits `infrastructure/argocd/k8s/applications/*.yaml`'s `source.path` without
  checking the file actually moved there

### GREEN — Write Minimal Skill

1. Write the smallest skill that addresses the documented failures
2. Re-run the same task WITH the skill present
3. Verify the agent now follows the correct pattern
4. If failures persist, expand the skill — do not deploy a broken skill

### REFACTOR — Close Loopholes

1. Test under pressure: complex tasks, time constraints, multiple concerns
2. Watch for new rationalizations or workarounds
3. Add explicit counters for each identified workaround
4. Re-test until the skill is reliable

## Skill File Structure

```markdown
---
name: kebab-case-name
description: Use when [specific triggering conditions].
---

## Overview
One paragraph: what this skill covers and why it exists.

## When to Use
Bullet list of concrete triggers.

## Core Pattern / Quick Reference
Tables, code blocks, checklists — the main content.

## Common Mistakes
What the agent gets wrong without this skill.
```

### Frontmatter Rules

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `name` | Lowercase, hyphens only. Must match folder name. |
| `description` | Starts with "Use when...". Max 1024 chars. Describes WHEN to activate, not WHAT the skill contains. |

### The Description Is Critical

The `description` field determines when the agent loads the skill. A vague description means the skill is never activated or activated at wrong times.

**Good:** `Use when releasing a new image for a core/infrastructure app — pushing a version tag, updating a Helm chart's values.yaml image tag, or adding a build+push GitHub Actions workflow for a new app.`

**Bad:** `Skill about CI/CD and how image releases work.`

Rules:
- Start with "Use when..."
- List concrete triggers: file names, workflow steps, commands
- Never summarize the workflow — only describe activation conditions

---

## Content Guidelines

### What to Include

- **File paths and directory structure** relevant to the area
- **Real examples from this repo** (not generic Kubernetes/Docker advice)
- **Checklists** for multi-step workflows (e.g. "Adding a new core app checklist")
- **Tables** for quick reference (conventions, required secrets, port numbers)
- **Rules and constraints** the agent cannot derive by reading the manifests alone
- **Common mistakes** specific to this area

### What NOT to Include

- Generic Kubernetes/Helm/Docker advice — the agent already knows this
- Rules already in `CLAUDE.md` — cross-reference instead of duplicating
- Long narrative explanations — prefer tables, code blocks, bullets
- Outdated patterns — verify against the current manifests before writing
- Information the agent can discover by reading the file (e.g. a chart's own values already documented in its comments)

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|---|---|
| Narrative examples tied to a specific past session/migration | Becomes stale immediately, wastes tokens |
| Descriptions that summarize workflow | Agent loads skill at wrong times or never |
| Duplicating `CLAUDE.md` rules | Creates conflicts when rules are updated in one place |
| Generic code/YAML examples | Agent ignores them — use real repo patterns |
| Deploying untested skills | No evidence the skill actually changes agent behavior |
| Skills over 400 lines | Token waste — split into focused skills or trim |

---

## Token Efficiency

Skills are loaded into context automatically. Every word costs tokens and competes with the actual task.

- Target **under 200 words** for frequently-loaded skills
- Maximum **400 lines** for any skill — split if larger
- Use tables instead of prose for reference data
- Cross-reference other skills (`see skill: commit-and-pr`) instead of repeating content
- Compress examples to the minimum that shows the pattern

---

## Existing Skills — Check Before Creating

| Skill | Area |
|-------|------|
| `commit-and-pr` | Conventional Commits, staging, PR shape |
| `writing-skills` | How to create and maintain skills |

Before creating a new skill, check if the topic fits into an existing one. Extending an existing skill is better than creating overlap.

## Quality Checklist

Before deploying a skill, verify:

- [ ] **RED tested:** Documented baseline failure without the skill
- [ ] **GREEN tested:** Verified the skill fixes the failure
- [ ] **REFACTOR tested:** Closed loopholes under pressure scenarios
- [ ] `name` matches the folder name
- [ ] `description` starts with "Use when..." and lists concrete triggers
- [ ] No duplication with `CLAUDE.md`
- [ ] No overlap with other skills (cross-reference instead)
- [ ] All file paths exist and are relative to project root
- [ ] All examples match current repo state
- [ ] Content is concise — tables and code blocks over prose
- [ ] Skill is under 400 lines
